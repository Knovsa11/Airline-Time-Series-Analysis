# Airline-Time-Series-Analysis

## Project Objective

This project aims to predict the number of airline passengers using historical data from 1949 to 1959. This prediction can be used for capacity optimization, strategic planning, and more effective business decision making in the airline industry.

## Problem Statement

Airlines face challenges in managing flight capacity, optimizing schedules, and anticipating passenger demand fluctuations. Without accurate analysis, companies may experience under or overcapacity, affecting operational efficiency and profitability.

Through a time series forecasting model, this project helps:

Identify seasonal patterns in passenger numbers.

Predict short-term and long-term trends.

Provide insights for resource planning and marketing strategies

## Background

The aviation industry heavily relies on historical data for operational planning. By understanding passenger demand patterns, airlines can:

Adjust the number of flights during peak and off-peak periods.

Optimize ticket pricing based on demand predictions.

Plan more effective marketing strategies.

The dataset used contains 144 entries from 1949 to 1959, with monthly passenger numbers.

## Project Output

Analysis of trends and seasonal passenger patterns.

A time series forecasting model to predict future passenger numbers.

Data visualization to understand monthly and yearly passenger fluctuations.

Model performance evaluation to select the best forecasting approach.

## Methodology

Machine Learning Modeling:

Short Term Load Forecasting (STLF) as it provides better results than other models.

Model evaluation using time series accuracy metrics like MAE, RMSE, and etc.

Future Predictions:

Using the best model to project passenger numbers for the coming months or years.

## Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

PyCaret → For automated time series model selection.

Pandas → For data manipulation.

Matplotlib & Seaborn → For trend and seasonal pattern visualization.
